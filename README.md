Plan realisation.

1. Project setup: vscode file preparation, setup. Creating GIT repository.
2. App visual side understanding + app structure. Component and folders logic.
3. JSON Server initialisation + data.
4. Main Page : css styles + config.
5. SideBar, Header, Searchbar - visual part creation.
6. Teamlist on the page.
7. Actions, selectors, reducer, store, initialState - Redux setup.
8. TeamView initialisation. Styles + back button.
9. Edit button on TeamView
10. Hooks and Actions for edit button (team + member)
11. TeamConfig with inputs.
12. URL link for members adjusted.
13. Styles for inputs and buttons.
14. Search on the main page.
15. Enter option on Save button added.
16. Header and Searchbar removed from TeamView and TeamConfig pages
17. Proptypes added.
18. Responsive interface.

What I would improve with more time:

1. Check the app structure, make it more efficient.
2. Check code quality once again and make it more efficient.
3. Add errorMessages for inputs if the value.length is 0.
4. Add validations for inputs (allowed symbols and length).
5. Check CSS and make it more efficient.
6. Improve responsive interface. Concentrate more on user experience.
7. Implement real rounting for sidebar items.
8. Add combineReducers to split Redux state into smaller parts.
9. Double check all components, proptypes.
